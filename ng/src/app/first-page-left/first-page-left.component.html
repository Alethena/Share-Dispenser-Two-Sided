    The Alethena Share Dispenser has two sides: The first side constitutes an offer to the Swiss public to
    buy up to 2'000 tokenized registered shares of Equility AG for between CHF 6.00 and CHF 6.50 each
    (the price increases linearly with each sold share), raising up to CHF 12'500 at an implied market
    capitalization of up to CHF 9 million.
    The second side is an offer to buy shares back from Swiss
    shareholders. <br><br>
    These shares will be held on the balance sheet of Equility AG. The main purpose of these
    offers is to demonstrate and test our share dispenser.
    <span class="custom-bold">
      These offers are for Swiss residents only
    </span>, for other
    jurisdictions please check your local requirements. <br><br>
    Please note that these offers are non-binding and
    in particular subject to the availability of share tokens or payment tokens as well as other requirements
    Equility AG may impose from time to time. Equility AG reserves the right to change the terms of or revoke
    these offers at any time.
